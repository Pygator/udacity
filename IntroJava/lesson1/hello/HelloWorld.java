// Welcome to your first programming exercise! This is the Udacity IDE or 
// "Integrated Development Environment," where you submit your code.

// If you have BlueJ installed, it is a good idea to use it for programming. Then
// you just paste the solution here. For this assignment, start out with this
// BlueJ project: lesson1/twoLineHello

// Look for lines that begin with two slashes! These are "comments" and 
// we will use them to let you know what you should do on each programming
// exercise. Have fun!
